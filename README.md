# Small-Ocaml-Projects

Assignment 1: Fimiliarising my self with ocaml syntax

Assignment 2: 
Q1.1: Defining an intersection function
Q1.2: Convert propositions to  Negation Normal Form (NNF)
Q1.3: Defining a type Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)
Q1.4: Implement funtion distribution over CNF experssions and convert NNF to CNF
Q1.5: collect positives and negatives from a proposition in CNF
Q1.6: implement the function cnf_tautology: cnf -> bool that tells us when a proposition in CNF is a tautology
Q2: Use structural induction to prove that a head-recurive expression and a tail-recursiove version are equivalent

Assignment 3:
Q1.1: Return a list of successive even numbers starting with 0
Q1.2: Write a function let fib (max : int): int list = ... that returns a list of Fibonacci numbers that are smaller than max
Q1.3: Write a function let pascal (max : int): int list list =. .. that returns
      the list of rows of the Pascal triangle that are shorter than max
Q1.4: Consider the function zip that takes two lists and returns a tuple of elements from each list
      Write a short implementation of this function using unfold-function
Q2.1: Write the function memo_one. It stores one value in 'cache'
Q2.2: Write the function memo_many. It stores n-values in 'cache' , given n-value
Q3.1: Write the function 'cons' that adds an element to a circular list
Q3.2: Write the function 'length' that gives the length of a circular list
Q3.3: Write the function 'to_list' that converts a circular list to a list
Q3.4: Write the function 'rev' that that reverses the directions of the circular list
Q3.5: Write the function 'map' that maps a function to a circular list in an analogous way to List.map.
Q3.6: Write the function 'eq' that compares two lists. In particular we want the following properties to
      hold of equality:
        1. Given a list l it is always the case that eq l (next l)= true
        2. Given a list l it is always the case that eq l (prev l)= true
        3. Lists with different lengths may be equal if their contents go together one by one.
